# Reviewer Output Format

All provider prompts request the same structured output so `parse_structured_review()`
in the vendored `_common/session/io.py` can extract findings uniformly. Include this template verbatim
in every prompt.

## Template

```
### Reasoning
Full analysis of the plan covering sequencing, hidden assumptions,
missing validation, rollback, and dependency gaps.

### Blocking Issues
- [B1] (HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW) Short description of blocking issue
  Section: <plan section name> (lines <N-M>)
  Recommendation: Concrete fix or mitigation

(Write "None" if no blocking issues.)

### Non-Blocking Issues
- [N1] Short description of non-blocking issue
  Section: <plan section name> (lines <N-M>)
  Recommendation: Suggested improvement

(Write "None" if no non-blocking issues.)

VERDICT: APPROVED or VERDICT: REVISE
```

## Rules

- Per-issue confidence (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) is **required** on blocking
  issues, optional on non-blocking.
- Section and line references refer to the numbered plan provided in the prompt.
- The final non-empty line of the response must be exactly
  `VERDICT: APPROVED` or `VERDICT: REVISE` — nothing else.
- Each round uses fresh per-round IDs (`B1`, `B2`, `N1`, ...). Do not ask the
  reviewer to continue numbering from a previous round; the host maps cross-round
  findings by content similarity.

## Two-pass variant (only when a Domain context block is present)

When the prompt includes a Domain context block (see SKILL.md → "Domain context"),
replace the single `### Reasoning` section with the two sections below, in this order.
Leave `### Blocking Issues` / `### Non-Blocking Issues` / `VERDICT:` exactly as above —
the parser reads only those two finding sections, so the passes carry reasoning, not
findings.

```
### Pass A - Independent critique
Stress-test the plan on its own merits. Do NOT assume the Domain context criteria are
correct or complete; critique as if no criteria had been supplied.

### Pass B - Domain-criteria critique
For each supplied criterion, state whether the plan meets it. Then challenge the criteria
themselves: flag any that are incomplete, self-serving, or in tension with better
practice, and reflect a wrong criterion in the verdict rather than rubber-stamping it.
```

Findings from BOTH passes go in the single Blocking / Non-Blocking lists below. Optionally
prefix a finding's description (after the `[B1] (HIGH)` tag, never before it) with `(A)`
or `(B)` to mark which pass surfaced it. Omit Pass B entirely if no Domain context block
was supplied — then Pass A is the whole review and `### Reasoning` may be used instead.
